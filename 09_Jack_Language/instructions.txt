0. Create a folder for your program. Let's call it the program folder.

1. Write your Jack program – a set of one or more Jack classes – each stored in
a separate className.jack text file. Keep all these .jack files in the same
program folder.

2. Compile the program folder using the supplied Jack compiler. This will cause
the compiler to translate all the .jack classes found in the folder into
corresponding .vm files, stored in the same folder. If a compilation error is
reported, debug the program and re-compile until no error messages are issued.

3. At this point the program folder should contain your source .jack files,
along with the compiled .vm files. To test the compiled program, load the
program folder into the supplied VM emulator. Then run the program in the VM
emulator. If you encounter run-time errors or undesired program behavior, fix
the program and go to stage 2.

Game Idea: "Memory Match"

Description:
Create a memory matching game where the player needs to match pairs of cards. The game board consists of a grid of cards, each with a hidden image. The player can select two cards at a time, trying to find matching pairs. If the cards match, they remain face up. If they don't match, they flip back over. The goal is to match all the pairs in the fewest number of moves.

Features:

Grid Layout: Create a grid layout for the game board, with a customizable number of rows and columns.
Randomized Card Placement: Randomly distribute the card images in the grid at the beginning of each game.
User Interaction: Allow the player to select two cards by clicking on them. Handle the logic for matching and non-matching pairs.
Score Tracking: Keep track of the player's moves and display the current score (number of moves taken).
Timer: Add a timer to track the time taken to complete the game.
Win Condition: Display a congratulatory message when all pairs have been successfully matched and offer the option to start a new game.
User Interface: Design an appealing user interface with suitable graphics and animations for card flips and matches.
Implementation:
You can implement this game in the Jack language using the provided tools and libraries. Break down the development process into smaller tasks, such as creating classes for the game board, card management, user interface components, and handling user input.

Remember to utilize the previously implemented tools and libraries from earlier projects, such as the Keyboard, Screen, and Memory modules. You can also consider incorporating sound effects or music to enhance the gaming experience, if time and resources allow.

By developing "Memory Match," you'll gain experience in managing user interactions, implementing game logic, and creating an interactive application within the constraints of the nand2tetris project framework.
